A Hyperlinked Video Player
=================
We had to implement a hyperlinked video player which would read meta files created by its supplementary hyperlinked 
video authoring tool and play videos in a JFrame, also change videos when the user clicks on the rectangular hyperlink.
It also supported audio playback.

This video player thus had the following functions:
•  Reading and interpreting meta files.
•	Playing videos in succession while respecting the frame rate of the videos.
•	Keeping the audio in sync with the video.
•	Maintaining the video stack to go to the next or previous video.
•	Interpolation of Hyperlinks (shown by a red rectangle)
•	Play Pause or Stop the video.
